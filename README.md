# Main-Project

1. Dehex Algorithm (Symmetric Key Cryptography)
2. Elliptical Curve Cryptography
3. SHA for key Management
4. Connection to cloud for storage
5. Sending the original key to the receiver for authentication at the decryption side.

6. If the key which is encrypted by SHA at both receiver side and at the SHA-Hased Key stored at the cloud, then decryption process starts.
7. Otherwise the decryption process will not occur.

8. It is also subjected to Small GUI Using Tkinter Window.
